Privacy Policy
Last updated: February 26, 2026

Introduction
This Privacy Policy applies to the game Pop Word. We value your privacy and want to be transparent about how we handle your information.

Data Collection and Use
Pop Word is designed to be played primarily offline and does not directly collect, store, or share personal data with the developer.

  -In-Game Sponsorships: The game features designated static areas within the virtual environment used for self-promotion or internal sponsorships. These "sponsor slots" are built into the game assets and    do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or behavioral advertising IDs to track user activity.
  -No External Accounts: The game does not use third-party logins, cloud saves (outside of Meta's system), or external leaderboards managed by the developer.

However, to function on the Meta Quest platform, the system may rely on basic Meta Quest platform services which process certain technical data:

Platform Analytics
Meta provides anonymized, aggregated analytics to the developer through the Meta Quest Developer Dashboard. This includes:
  -Unique Users: Number of people who launched the app.
  -Device Info: Hardware type (e.g., Quest 3) and OS versions.
  -Regional Data: Aggregated distribution by country.
  -Performance: Crash reports and frame rate metrics.

These reports are strictly for performance monitoring and optimization and do not contain personally identifiable information (PII).

Internet Access and Permissions
While Pop Word is a single-player experience, internet connectivity may be utilized by the Meta Quest system for:
  -Standard platform updates and entitlement checks.
  -Basic analytics reporting as described above.
  -Displaying internal sponsorship assets if they are updated remotely.

No personal data is transmitted to the developer's private servers.

Data Deletion Requests
Because Pop Word does not store personal data or user accounts on private developer-side databases, there is no information for the developer to delete.
Any platform-level data managed by Meta can be addressed through:

  -Your Meta account settings → Privacy Center.
  -Or by contacting the developer for guidance at: 📧 ravensrosedev@gmail.com

Children’s Privacy
Pop Word does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Any technical data processed for app stability is handled exclusively by Meta according to their safety guidelines for VR users.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted within the app or on the store page with a new revision date.
